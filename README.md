# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Overview
My personal learning with the principles of data storage in Arrays, ArrayLists & LinkedList nodes. I will understand their operations and performance with visualizations; Implement low-level linear, linked data structures with recursive methods, and explore their edge cases. Extend these structures to the Abstract Data Types, Stacks, Queues and Deques.
